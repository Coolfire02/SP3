Ghost - starts off in idle state. Upon entering range, starts slowly following the player. In this state, shining the flashlight on the ghost will blind them and stop them from following you. Upon entering a second much closer range, the ghost speeds up by a lot and starts attacking the player. In this state, if the player gets far enough from the ghost (maybe through portal ability etc), ghost goes to wander state for a period of time before going back to idle. regardless of state, once they are attacked by the player, they enter rage and permanently chase down and attack the player at a faster speed.
Grim Reaper(BOSS) - Constantly Chases down the player. Once in attack range, stops moving in order to whack his scynthe. If player is still in range when the reaper swings his scythe, player gets damaged. Grim Reaper's HP is dependent on number of tombstones left intact in the scene. Intensify the flashlight on them in order to destroy them.

//STORY

***INTRO***
Player plays as Robertia. Robertia wakes up in an empty room with nothing but a time machine looking object, with amnesia. The time machine is her only clue to what happened to her. However, upon interaction, it explodes into 4 separate pieces, each warping into a new time/dimension, opening a link/portal to those worlds while doing so. Robertia now has to travel to each world and find the parts in order to put the machine back together and find out what happened to her.
***ENDING***
Robertia now has all the parts and sets up the machine. She triggers it and is warped.
She finds herself in the same room, however, she is with two other people, who are having an argument. One of them is Robert, a pink-haired guy with a smug look on his face. The other person however, is a blonde haired girl who looks exactly like Robertia. Though not revealed in the dialogue in the game, it is obvious and clear that this girl is Robertia from another timeline. Due to the two existing in the same timeline, the world desperately tried to erase one of them, causing both of them to feel pressure and uncomfortable as if the space around them is closing in on them. In this state, Robertia, before understanding the situation, accidentally triggers the time machine again, and is warped into another timeline. 
Robertia wakes up in the same room with nothing but the machine. However, the effects of the time travelling causes her memory loss and she once again has amnesia.
Essentially it's an endless loop, where the player only plays through one loop.
